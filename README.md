# testFramework

A description of this package.

### Note :-

This is just an example framework to test the Swift package manager

### Points Learnt :-

- use the same folder structure to enable swift to find your package, git usually creates a folder named after the repo and then puts the files in that folder , but SPM cant find swift.package in that structure so follow the structure in this repo.(this is if you use git repo's , if you use custom paths i guess you can use whatever structure you want)
- look at the example in the TestPackageManagerExample repo for more knowledge gained from Swift Package Manager
